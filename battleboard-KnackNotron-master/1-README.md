Exploration of simple Arrays in Java

As a continuation of the units in Java - beyond simple primitive data types and String manipulation, it's time to think a little deeper about how we can manipulate, access, store data in Java.

Think of the example of a teacher with a class of 20 students, creating a simple roster.
For each student in the class, the may have multiple pieces of information associated with them, but lets just think of a list of names for now.

If we were to create a String variable for each student, i.e. String name1 = "Lucy"; etc - it might be a challenge to print the roster each time, by listing out each variable that corresponds to each student.  Perhaps there is a better way to store similar data without all the variables or 'buckets' of information.

**Enter the Array**

An array in java works like a list or other grouping of data that allows you to store groups of similar information, under one name, and reference each **element** using an index.

Arrays are identified by the square brackets following the name of the array, and must be typed.
For example:  an array may up of Strings may be *DECLARED* as follows:

String[ ] names

However - Java demands that an array must be also initialized with a capacity when first created, so

String[ ] names = new String[ 30 ];

where *names* is the name of the Array of Strings, and it has 30 places.  **Note that we cannot add more spaces to the array after initialization, so plan ahead.  Yes - we can talk about form and design later, but for now - ok to think about planning ahead and adding a few more than needed.**

**How do I add?**
Use the index - by setting a value into the index.
names[3] = "Linus";

**What about multiples?**
  names[] = {"charlie", "lucy" , "pigpen"};

**Can I print an array?**
  No. Printing an array will print the location or memory index - NOT the values.
  You will have to iterate through each of the elements and print separately - think for or adnvance for:each loop
